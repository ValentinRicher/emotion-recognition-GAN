# Emotion Recognition with semi-supervised GAN

The goal of this work was to assemble two models used to depict emotions on faces. These models are Action Units and Valence Arousal. <br/>
Action Units are facial muscle movements. The combination of these Action Units can be interpreted as an emotion. 
Valence Arousal is a 2D continuous scale where Valence represents how positive or negative a person is when feeling an emotion and Arousal represents how excited or calm the person is. <br/>
Now the possibility to run the code with the facemotion repository ! 

# To Do

- Add metrics for the real or fake images âœ…
- Upload the dataset to a repository on GitHub and use Google Cloud Platform
- Upload the dataset to Google Drive and use Google Colab
- Connect the GAN repo with the dataset repo to create automatic downloading
- Re-organize the facemotion.py to the same level as other .py files
- Create an architecture for 64*64 images
- Create an architecture for 96*96 images
