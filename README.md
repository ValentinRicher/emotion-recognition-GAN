# Emotion Recognition with semi-supervised GAN

The goal of this work was to assemble two models used to depict emotions on faces. These models are Action Units and Valence Arousal.
Action Units are facial muscle movements. The combination of these Action Units can be interpreted as an emotion. 
Valence Arousal is a 2D continuous scale where Valence represents how positive or negative a person is when feeling an emotion and Arousal represents how excited or calm the person is.

# To Do

- Download the dataset from a Kaggle dataset
- Create an architecture for 64*64 images
- Create an architecture for 96*96 images
- Add metrics for the real or fake images âœ…
